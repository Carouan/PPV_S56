## Projects

The OpenJS Foundation hosts some of the most important projects in the JavaScript ecosystem. As a neutral non-profit organization, our goal is to provide a home where projects can build and support a sustainable community of diverse contributors.

## Overview

We strongly believe in sharing best practices and reducing redundant administrative work across projects, particularly when it comes to non-technical governance.  To that end we have the Cross Project Council, or CPC, to centralize coordination among projects as well as certain technical governance and moderation processes.  One of the CPC’s primary functions will be to oversee the progression of projects between stages of their lifecycles.

## Hosted Projects

Projects hosted by the OpenJS Foundation fall into one of four categories. The CPC oversees an Incubation process for projects which seek to be hosted by the OpenJS Foundation. The project lifecycle is documented in the Project Progression proposal.

## Project Funding Opportunities

All funding received through OpenJS Foundation membership dues is used to support various programs that benefit our hosted projects, and to run the Foundation.  This funding is administered by the Board of Directors, which is comprised of elected community leaders and member company representatives.  
  
The OpenJS Foundation recognizes that in addition to supporting the general activities of the OpenJS Foundation (through membership, event sponsorship, and certification), some organizations may wish to contribute additional monetary funding to the OpenJS Foundation for activities that benefit specific projects or initiatives.  
  
OpenJS Foundation members who are current on their annual dues may contribute additional amounts of incremental monetary funding to specific OpenJS Foundation initiatives, such as roadshows, Cross Project Council activities, or project infrastructure. Directed monetary funding activities must be approved by the OpenJS Executive Director, and are subject to the following annual limits:  
  
Platinum members: No cap on directed monetary funding  
Gold members: Capped at 50% of annual dues amount  
Silver members: Capped at 25% of annual dues amount

  
The Board of Directors may approve exceptions on a case-by-case basis.  
  
Please note that these limits only apply to incremental monetary funding contributed directly to the OpenJS Foundation.  Aside from OpenJS Foundation membership and the incremental monetary funding described above, we strongly encourage organizations to invest in the health and sustainability of the community at large by employing contributors, encouraging and supporting employees as they grow into leadership roles, running local meetups, and open sourcing their projects.
