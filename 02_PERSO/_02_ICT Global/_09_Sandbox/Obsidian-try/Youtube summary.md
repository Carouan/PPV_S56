hey so today we'll be learning ~={cyan}something=~ really interesting I promise you it'll be very fun be really exciting it's a bit of a long tutorial but we learn about web application security and before we start hacking kits remember to ask your mom for permission first so first you have a target of interest and in this case it could be a Target like a website and it <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">could</span> be say <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">example</span>.com that you're going after or it could be a specific IP address it could be certain domains and so on so all this are the potential targets that you can go after and the first thing you want to do is of course you want to use a tool like say nmap or certain Discovery tools that can help you look into the specific Target and say okay what are all the different services that are installed within it say for example do they have a HTTP server do they have a website running have databases do they have some kind of administrative portal that you can go after then you look for unpatched systems where there could be S specific vulnerabilities that you can go after and sometimes they are available directly as exploits or you can craft your own payloads against those Target services and then you load this payload right into the service giving you control of the entire computer and as a pro haacker all you need is one entry point to gain access to the entire computer and right in front of us I have call Linux running and this is perhaps your favorite operating system for hacking or it could also be Windows XP it doesn't matter which operating system you're using could even hack from your phone so the first thing we do we want to discover devices within say a network or any specific Target IP address and this tool is usually used the moment you join those free Wi-Fi at the cafe at the shopping mall at all these different places and once you're in there you want to uncover all these devices within the same network and you want to Target them later on so this is the reason why You' be using that disc discover for that I can see right here I have a specific Target in this case 1 1821 16801 100 so this is the IP address that we're going after the next thing you do is you want to enumerate all those services within this IP address and see which one of them are potentially open vulnerable and can go ahead and Target them so you use a tool like nmap which is Network mapping tool sv21 68100 he enter in this and now we are scanning this IP address looking out for all those Services they're running and then after which we could possibly Target them from there so let's give it a couple more seconds for to scan true all those ports and be able to identify those services for us then later on we can start looking into the services awesome the scan is completed now and this is a very important list because this list would tell us some important things that we can go after first it has secure shell open meaning that there is some kind of ability for us to remotely connect over to the computer and control it there's also tnet that is a mill server and you can see a huge list here right HTTP as well which is commonly used for web services and you have otter like pop three IMAP sbar possibly different types of file sharing services and another one which is netkit rsh probably some kind of remote control services and so on so several http2 that we can easily go into and take a look at things there um NFS as well so lots of different Services they're running within this single IP address within this single server next up we can open up your favorite browser so in this case I have Firefox you could also be using Internet Explorer if that's your favorite browser you go and enter directly into the IP address so in this case we're at21 1680 to100 you click on to it and it says hey this is a vulnerable server and so on so this is again a good service a good operating system for us to test out on so what we really want to do next is to start crawling against the web server and see whether there are any sensitive Pages any login Pages any specific pages of functions that they have available for us to go after so I can use a tool like nto followed by one 21 16.01 100 he entering this and now we're scanning we're scanning against this specific IP address and we're looking out for different pages directories that we can access into and you can see over here we have docc we have imgs we have PHP my admin this is a very important page we probably need to log in into in order to see all those information within the site and we have icons PHP L admin now with all this identification you can directly browse over into say PHP my admin or lb admin and you're able to see there's a login page you can click on to it and you're navigating across all these different services and see whether you're able to log in and gather the data information for it so you have to login DN you have password you click Anonymous authenticate are you able to get in are you able to search for things and if I would switch over to PHP my admin hit enter on that likewise right it prompts you straight away for username password so we don't have any of those information with us so we need to start enumerating more and we can possibly try to go to other services so for example in this case we saw one port 10,000 when I clicked on to this I see here we have a web Min server and a lot of this different operating systems or services or virtual service whichever service they are they need some kind of tool to help them administer the server and the server could have databases it could have your web servers and all these different Services they're running and you need to administer them from a simple portal so there's a couple of things we can do we can search search sploit and see where you can find any specific payloads or exploits available directly with this service so in this case we can see that we have several of them and we likely need to pinpoint a specific one that we can go after at the same time we can also use like pseudo msf console to help us see whether there are directly easily available modules that we can use for mploy that can make things a lot easier for us as part of attacking the web server so in this case if you go ahead and load into MPL and you search webmin you can find a few modules or entry points and we can easily use them so in this case the one that we can use you'll be using several of them and I've used many of them I've tested them out manually as well to see whether it's vulnerable and the good news is auxiliary admin weetman file disclosure is the one that works so if you go ahead and enter use one show options and you go ahead and enter say set our host to2 168 0 to 100 so we're targeting this specific IP address and once you're ready just go ahead and hit answer on that and you can see the r path so this is the file that we're going to enumerate is at C passwd and if I go ahead and the run you can see we got some results over here and this result we can see that we got all those users all those different identities from the operating system directly because of a vulnerability related to the webman service if you want to find out more about why this module work you can enter show info and from show info you can see right here this is the webman file disclosure and this is the disclos date or we have all this different information here and you have the references so we can go ahead and search up on this and see why this is occurring and we can manually exploit it too because we don't want to be a script Kitty and here we are at webin exploit database and this is the one that we'll be using and if we screw down further you you can see the payload and why works so if you see right here we have something interesting so I'm going to break this down for you you have the HTTP and the Target and the port so in this case say Port 10,000 and you go into this specific path which is SL unauthenticated and there we a tamam so tamam over here you can see it references to the earlier one and this variable here is a SL do dot or I follow by percentage 01 * 40 and Then followed by the file name so this is a way for you to manually exploit the vulnerable service so right now let's go ahead and launch burp suit as our Interceptor in entering that and we're now launching burp Suite so this is going to be our Interceptor I'll be using this as part of launching the attack so what we can do now is to intercept the requests I'm going to close onto the update and now we have burp suit running let's go ahead and maximize on this and you can see the proxy intercept is on and what we want to do now is go ahead and hit enter in this and we are taking and picking it up from the intercept so if you can see the interception right here I can send this over into repeater and once in repeater tab what I can do is go and click Send and you get a response directly from the web server and the payload that we saw earlier we're going to copy and paste it right here and see what we get as a result you can see right here I got the payload and a payload looks like this all right so there are 40 off/ dot dot percentage 01 so that was used as the payload so what I can do now is go Ahad and click Send and we get result you can see right here this is the result and we even got one which is 1 OS admin that has a protected password value that we could possibly try to crack later on using some other cracking tools password cracking tools and we can see all this different information on uses here and we can reuse them we can possibly reuse them into those remote services that we can authenticate into and at the same time because now we have this fall inclusion vulnerability that we discovered we can try to go into are sensitive part of the operating system that could be storing some of these credentials like your usernames and passwords and try to reuse them and authenticate them into those other services so you recall earlier we did the network mapping scanner against 192168 01 100 and you can see several of the services here and some of the services for example like elap it means that this Al is running and there could be a specific folder inside the operating system that stores the credentials of alep and we'll be targeting that now I go back over into Interceptor and I'll change from Shadow to l. secret and see what we get as a result click Send boom you can see right here we have a secret value can you hack me so this is likely the password that we can use to authenticate to possibly outter services in hopes that the password is being reuse for many of these services so what I can do now is go ahead and save this over into a file can you hack me and I'll save these over into say password.txt and of course I can do a cap password.txt and of course we can see that this is the value that has been saved inside this file and the next thing we want to do is go back over into burp suite and we have the at C all right followed by passwd we want to save this as well so let's go ahead and click Send and we'll save all of these values over into a file as well so that we can reuse them as part of attacking the server let's go ahead and copy this and I can do a pseudo Mouse and perhaps let's go ahead and save this over into list of usern names.txt H enter on this I've already saved it all right so this is the list of usernames that we have from the earlier result now we saw Port 22 open and we want to test it out and
